I drag myself out of bed and put in the full training run, even though I'd rather be brunching. Each run is moving me closer to a personal best on race day, and that achievement will be so much sweeter than bottomless mimosas.	hedonism	achievement					
You have two job offers after graduation. One is a low-paying position at a non-profit doing meaningful work you're passionate about. The other is a high-paying corporate gig with great benefits that would let you live large, but in a bland industry you're not excited about.	I take the cushy corporate job. With that kind of salary, I'll be living the good life! I can treat myself to nice dinners, travel, a swanky apartment - I'm going to enjoy the heck out of my 20s.	I accept the non-profit position. The lower pay is worth it to do work that I know makes a difference. If I do well there, I'll have great experience under my belt to springboard to future opportunities to advance my career in this field.	hedonism	achievement					
You are an up-and-coming fashion designer preparing for fashion week. You have a solid collection pulled together that's sure to be well-received. However, you have a wild idea for a show-stopping avant garde piece that would really get you noticed. But the piece is risky and creating it would be an all-consuming endeavor in the limited time left.	I decide to stick with my current solid collection. I'll get good exposure regardless without running myself ragged. I want to actually be able to enjoy fashion week, not work myself into the ground.	I go for it with the ambitious avant garde piece. I'll pour all my creative energy into bringing this vision to life. Debuting a head-turning, buzz-worthy piece is worth all the long nights. If I can pull this off, it will launch my design career to the next level.	hedonism	achievement					
You are an author working on a new novel. You have a draft that is pretty good, but you know that with a few more months of intense editing, it could go from pretty good to outstanding. However, those last grueling edits always feel like torture and you're itching to be done with this book.	I send the draft to my editor as-is. It's certainly good enough to publish and I'm ready to move on. I want to actually enjoy the process of putting new work out into the world, not agonize over every last comma.	I commit to the brutal final round of revisions. I know polishing this book to perfection will make me a better writer and lead to greater success. I'm willing to suffer for a few months of editing to create something I'm truly proud of and achieve my dreams of literary acclaim.	hedonism	achievement

You are at a family gathering and your aunt keeps making comments about your appearance that make you uncomfortable. You want to speak up, but you know it might cause tension.

I remain polite and ignore my aunt's comments, not wanting to disrupt the family gathering.	hedonism	conformity					
You are at a restaurant with a group of coworkers. Everyone is ordering healthy options, but you really want to indulge in a decadent dessert.

You are on a business trip and have an early meeting the next morning. Your colleagues invite you out for drinks at a local bar.

I indulge in the array of desserts, savoring each delicious bite without worrying about the consequences. After all, it's a special occasion and I deserve to treat myself.

You are on a budget-friendly family vacation at a popular beach resort. Your children are eager to try out the many water activities available, but you know that these extras can quickly add up.	I decide to splurge on the water activities, rationalizing that the joy and excitement my children will experience are worth the extra cost. It's a vacation, after all, and we should enjoy ourselves.	I explain to my children that we will stick to the beach and pool, which are included in our package, as it's important to be financially responsible and adhere to our family's traditional values of frugality.	hedonism	tradition					
You are at a family gathering and your elderly grandmother has prepared a traditional dish that you have never enjoyed. She serves you a large portion and looks at you expectantly.

You are planning your wedding and your parents are insisting on a traditional ceremony in line with your family's cultural and religious background. However, you and your partner have always dreamed of a more modern, personalized celebration.	I stand my ground and insist on having the wedding that my partner and I have envisioned, even if it means going against my family's wishes. It's our special day, and we should celebrate it in a way that brings us the most joy.	I agree to incorporate more traditional elements into the wedding to appease my parents and honor my family's cultural heritage, even though it may not be exactly what my partner and I had in mind.	hedonism	tradition					
You are on a business trip and your colleagues invite you to a popular nightclub after a long day of meetings. You're tired and know that you have another early start the next day, but you also want to bond with your coworkers.

I politely decline the invitation, explaining that I need to get a good night's rest to be at my best for tomorrow's meetings. I prioritize my professional responsibilities and traditional work ethic over personal enjoyment.	hedonism	tradition					
You are at a family reunion and your conservative relatives are making comments that you find offensive. You want to speak up, but you know that doing so could cause a scene and upset the family dynamic.	I decide to bite my tongue and avoid confrontation, even though I strongly disagree with my relatives' views. I prioritize maintaining family harmony and respecting my elders over expressing my own opinions.

I'm willing to risk causing some discomfort in order to stand up for my values.	tradition	hedonism					
You are at a music festival with friends and they invite you to try some illegal substances. You've never done drugs before and you know it goes against your values, but your friends are insistent that it will enhance your experience.	I firmly decline my friends' offer, explaining that drug use goes against my personal beliefs and the values I was raised with. I'm confident that I can enjoy the festival without resorting to substance use.	I decide to let loose and try the drugs, reasoning that it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I don't want to miss out on any part of the festival. I prioritize the potential for increased pleasure over my traditional values.	tradition	hedonism					
You are on a dream vacation with your partner and they suggest skipping a day of sightseeing to spend the entire day relaxing at the resort. You've been looking forward to exploring the local culture and historical sites, but you also want to make your partner happy.	I agree to spend the day relaxing at the resort, prioritizing my partner's wishes and the opportunity for indulgence over my desire to immerse myself in the local culture.

You are at a friend's birthday party. The cake is being cut and handed out. You've been trying to lose weight and have been avoiding sweets, but the cake looks incredibly delicious.

Instead, I focus on celebrating my friend's special day with her, showing my love and support through conversation and helping with the party.	hedonism	benevolence					
You are on a tight budget this month but have been invited on a fun but expensive beach weekend getaway with friends. You really want to go but it would mean not being able to pay your full rent on time to your landlord, who is a kind elderly man on a fixed income.	I go on the trip, enjoying the sun and surf with my buddies. I can always catch up on rent next month. I deserve some fun and my landlord will understand.	I tell my friends I sadly can't make it this time in order to responsibly pay my rent. I visit my landlord and have a nice chat, seeing how he's doing. There will be other beach trips.	hedonism	benevolence					
You have front row tickets and backstage passes to see your favorite band. You've been looking forward to this for months. That same night, your sister has a big awards banquet for getting straight A's. She really wants you to be there.	I go to the concert and have the time of my life, getting photos and autographs with the band backstage. My sister has my parents there to support her. This is a once in a lifetime experience.	I give my tickets to a friend and attend my sister's awards banquet. Seeing her proud smile as she accepts her award is worth more than any concert. I'm so happy I could be there for her.	hedonism	benevolence					
You've been working long hours and feel you deserve a 'treat yourself' spa day. Your elderly neighbors mention their yard needs some major work and they can't handle it anymore. You know it would mean the world to them if you helped.	I book a full day of pampering at the nicest spa in town - massage, facial, mani/pedi, the works! I've earned this 'me time' with how hard I've been working. I can help the neighbors another day.	I spend my free day helping my elderly neighbors with their yardwork, even though I'm exhausted. Seeing their appreciation and knowing how much it helped them is rejuvenating in its own way.	hedonism	benevolence					
You're about to leave on an international trip you've been excitedly planning for months. The day before, your best friend calls you crying after being broken up with and asks if you can come be with them.	I express my sympathy but tell my friend I just can't cancel this trip last minute. I've been looking forward to this for so long and it's non-refundable. I'll check on them when I'm back.	I postpone my trip to be with my heartbroken best friend in their time of need. I know they would do the same for me. There will be other opportunities to travel.	hedonism	benevolence					
You have a free afternoon. You really want to spend it catching up on your favorite TV shows and napping. But you remember your sister has a hard exam coming up and could use some help studying.	I binge watch my shows all afternoon, laughing, crying, and getting completely wrapped up in the fictional characters' lives. My sister usually does fine on exams, she'll be okay without my help.	I go over to help quiz my sister on the material. We have a productive study session and I treat her to a coffee break. Her success is important to me.	hedonism	benevolence					
You agreed to watch your friend's dog while she's out of town, but caring for it is more work than you expected. A different group of friends invite you to go clubbing, which sounds way more fun.	I ditch the dog to go dancing and drinking with my buddies all night long. The dog will be okay on its own for a night and I could really use the excitement. My friend will never know.	I decline the clubbing invite to responsibly watch my friend's dog as promised. I take it on a long walk and give it lots of love. Being trustworthy and having integrity is important to me.	hedonism	benevolence					
You just got a big bonus at work. You've been eyeing the latest game console. Your little cousin's birthday is coming up and you know his parents can't afford to get him the gaming system he desperately wants.	I buy myself the latest console with all the bells and whistles. I've worked hard for this bonus and deserve to splurge on something just for me. I'll get my cousin a small gift instead.	I use my bonus money to surprise my little cousin with the gaming system of his dreams. Seeing the joy on his face is the best gift I could receive. I love that I can make his wish come true.	hedonism	benevolence					
You're at a festival with a group of friends. Everyone is having a blast drinking, dancing to the music, and eating tasty food. One friend seems withdrawn and says they want to leave early.	I stay at the festival with the rest of the group. We're all having such a good time and I don't want to end the fun early. My one friend will be fine ubering home alone.	I leave the festival early with my friend who isn't feeling it. We have a heart-to-heart talk back at my place. Supporting them is more important than another hour of partying.	hedonism	benevolence					
You're hanging out with some friends at the park when you see a wallet on the ground. It has a lot of cash in it. You could really use the money for an upcoming music festival ticket.	I discreetly pocket the cash before turning in the wallet. The owner will get their wallet back and I'll get to have an amazing time at the music festival. No one gets hurt.	I pick up the wallet and look for an ID so I can return it to the owner intact. I'd want someone to do the same for me. Going to the festival wouldn't feel right using someone else's lost money.	hedonism	benevolence					
You are on a tropical vacation and have the opportunity to participate in a once-in-a-lifetime experience swimming with dolphins. However, you've recently learned about the controversial practices of some dolphinariums and the potential negative impacts on the animals' well-being.	I choose to go swimming with the dolphins, as this is a unique experience that I've been looking forward to, and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to interact with these amazing creatures.	I decide to skip the dolphin swim and instead spend my time and money supporting a local marine conservation organization that works to protect dolphins and their habitats in the wild.	hedonism	universalism					
You are a city council member tasked with deciding whether to approve the construction of a new luxury high-rise apartment complex or a community center that would provide affordable housing and social services for low-income families.	I vote in favor of the luxury high-rise, as it will bring in more tax revenue for the city and boost property values in the area, which could benefit me and other property owners.	I vote for the community center, as it will provide much-needed support and resources for disadvantaged members of our community, promoting social justice and equality.	hedonism	universalism					
You are shopping for a new car and have narrowed down your choices to two options: a sleek, high-performance sports car that you've always dreamed of owning, or a more practical and eco-friendly hybrid vehicle.	I purchase the sports car, as I've worked hard to be able to afford my dream vehicle, and I want to enjoy the thrill and status that comes with driving it.	I choose the hybrid car, as it aligns with my values of reducing my carbon footprint and contributing to a more sustainable future for the planet.	hedonism	universalism					
You are planning your wedding and must decide between two potential venues: a luxurious resort that offers an all-inclusive package with top-notch amenities, or a more modest but eco-friendly location that supports local businesses and uses sustainable practices.	I book the luxurious resort, as I want my wedding day to be a lavish and memorable experience for myself and my guests, with all the bells and whistles.	I choose the eco-friendly venue, as it aligns with my values of supporting local communities and minimizing the environmental impact of my wedding.	hedonism	universalism					
You are a CEO deciding whether to invest in a new product line that has the potential for high profits but may involve unethical labor practices, or to invest in upgrading your company's facilities to be more environmentally sustainable and socially responsible.	I prioritize the new product line, as the potential financial gains are too significant to pass up, and the success of the company is my primary concern.	I choose to invest in the facility upgrades, as I believe it's crucial for our company to lead by example in terms of environmental stewardship and social responsibility, even if it means sacrificing some short-term profits.	hedonism	universalism					
You are on a business trip in a foreign country and have some free time to explore. You can either indulge in a luxurious spa day at your hotel or volunteer at a local orphanage that your colleague recommended.	I treat myself to the spa day, as I deserve to relax and pamper myself after working hard on this trip, and I want to make the most of my limited leisure time.	I spend my free time volunteering at the orphanage, as I feel it's important to give back to the local community and make a positive impact where I can, even while traveling for work.	hedonism	universalism					
You are planning a family vacation and must decide between two destinations: a luxury cruise with endless entertainment options and indulgent dining experiences, or an eco-tourism trip to a rainforest where you can learn about conservation efforts and support local communities.	I book the luxury cruise, as I want my family to have a fun and carefree vacation filled with exciting activities and delicious food, without worrying about anything else.	I choose the eco-tourism trip, as I believe it's important for my family to have an educational and meaningful travel experience that broadens our perspectives and allows us to contribute to a greater cause.	hedonism	universalism					
You are a consultant for a major corporation and have discovered that they are engaging in environmentally harmful practices to maximize profits. You must decide whether to keep quiet and protect your own job security or blow the whistle and potentially face backlash.	I keep quiet about the company's practices, as I don't want to risk losing my high-paying job and the comfortable lifestyle it affords me.	I report the company's unethical behavior to the appropriate authorities, as I feel a moral obligation to prioritize the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations over my personal gain.	hedonism	universalism					
You are a politician deciding whether to support a bill that would provide tax breaks for large corporations, potentially benefiting your own investments, or a bill that would increase funding for social welfare programs and environmental protection initiatives.	I vote for the corporate tax break bill, as it aligns with my own financial interests and could lead to increased profits and personal wealth.	I vote for the social welfare and environmental protection bill, as I believe it is my duty as a public servant to prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable members of society and to work towards a more equitable and sustainable future for all.	hedonism	universalism					
You are a journalist investigating a major corporation's alleged human rights violations in developing countries. You have the opportunity to publish a story that could damage the company's reputation and stock prices, or you could accept a bribe from the company to bury the story and advance your own career.	I accept the bribe and bury the story, as the financial reward and potential career advancement are too tempting to pass up, and I prioritize my own success and enjoyment above all else.	I refuse the bribe and publish the story, as I believe it is my ethical duty as a journalist to expose the truth and hold those in power accountable, even if it means sacrificing personal gain and facing potential backlash.	hedonism	universalism					
You are a recent graduate who has been offered two job opportunities. One is a high-paying corporate position that aligns perfectly with your skills and degree, but requires long hours and offers little work-life balance. The other is a lower-paying position at a non-profit organization working for a cause you believe in, with a better work-life balance.	I'll take the corporate job. It's a great opportunity to prove my capabilities and advance my career quickly. The high salary will allow me to pay off my student loans faster and establish financial security early on.	I'll accept the non-profit position. The work-life balance is important to me and I believe in their mission. Even if the pay is lower, I'll feel more fulfilled and secure in my role knowing I'm making a positive difference.	achievement	security					
You are a manager tasked with leading an important project. One of your team members is a top performer but often takes risks and challenges authority. Another is a reliable, consistent worker who always follows company protocol but may lack innovation.	I'll put the top performer in a lead role on the project. Their skills and ambition are what we need to push boundaries and achieve something truly remarkable, even if it means ruffling a few feathers.	I'll give the reliable team member a key role in the project. Their steadiness and adherence to proven processes will be essential in ensuring the project stays on track and doesn't introduce unnecessary risk to the company.	achievement	security					
You are a politician crafting your platform for an upcoming election. You must decide whether to focus your campaign on bold new policies that could jumpstart the economy but may be controversial, or on maintaining stability and reinforcing existing social safety nets.	I will campaign on a platform of ambitious economic reforms. We need fresh thinking and decisive action to unleash our country's full potential and secure our place as a leader on the global stage.	I will focus my campaign on protecting and strengthening the institutions and programs that provide security and stability for our citizens. Preserving social cohesion must be our priority in these uncertain times.	achievement	security					
You are an entrepreneur deciding on the direction to take your successful startup. You can either reinvest profits to scale up quickly and seize market share, or grow at a more controlled pace while building cash reserves to weather potential downturns.	I'll go full throttle on expansion. With our talented team and innovative product, we have the opportunity to become the dominant player in our space if we strike now. The risks are worth the potential rewards.	I'll opt for the more conservative growth strategy. Building a war chest will ensure we can sustain our business and protect our employees' jobs no matter what market conditions bring. Steady, stable growth is the key to long-term success.	achievement	security					
You are a parent advising your child on which extracurricular activities to pursue. They have the potential to be a star athlete, which would look impressive on college applications but requires an intense time commitment. Alternatively, they could choose lower-pressure activities that leave more time for family and friendships.	I'll encourage my child to go all in on sports. Excelling as an athlete will open doors for them and teach valuable lessons about discipline and performance under pressure. We'll do whatever it takes to help them be the best.	I'll suggest they choose activities that are enjoyable but not all-consuming. Preserving time to connect with family and develop solid friendships is essential for their emotional well-being and will serve them well throughout life.	achievement	security					
You are a doctor treating a patient with a serious condition. An experimental treatment shows promise but comes with significant risks and unknowns. The alternative is a standard treatment protocol that has more predictable outcomes but a lower ceiling for potential improvement.	I'll recommend the experimental treatment. The potential benefit to my patient is too substantial to pass up, and pushing the envelope is how medical breakthroughs happen. I'm confident in my abilities to navigate any complications.	I'll proceed with the standard treatment. My patient's health is too precious to gamble on an unproven approach, no matter how exciting. Providing the most empirically-supported care, even if results are modest, is my duty as a physician.	achievement	security					
You are a journalist investigating a sensitive story about corruption in local government. You have a lead on information that would break the story wide open, but from a source who will only talk if you guarantee anonymity. This violates your news organization's usual protocol.	I'll promise my source anonymity and run with the story. Getting the truth out there is what matters most, and landing a groundbreaking scoop like this will make my journalistic reputation. I'll deal with any ethical fallout later.	I'll regretfully pass on the source's offer and seek other avenues for the story. Compromising my integrity and my organization's standards is a line I won't cross, no matter how big the potential story. Trustworthy, accountable reporting must take priority.	achievement	security					
You are an environmentalist advising on conservation policy. A proposal to dramatically expand protected lands would secure critical habitats, but at the cost of disrupting the livelihoods of resource-dependent communities. An alternative plan better balances ecological and economic concerns but sets less ambitious conservation goals.	I'll fight for the expansive conservation proposal. Locking in protections on the maximum amount of habitat needs to be our top priority, even if it generates pushback. We must seize this opportunity for a landmark environmental victory.	I'll advocate for the balanced approach. While I wish we could protect more, a plan that keeps communities viable is more likely to succeed and stick in the long run. We can't risk a backlash that would undermine the durability of conservation gains.	achievement	security					
You are an executive overseeing your company's flagship product. Engineers have developed new features that would give it a major edge over competitors, but there are concerns about bugs and a tight timeline. Delaying the launch would mean missing a key market window.	I'll greenlight the new features and launch on schedule. We can't squander this chance to leap ahead and expand our market share. I have faith our team can resolve issues on the fly and deliver our most ambitious product yet.	I'll halt the new features and go to market with the current stable build, even if it means ceding some competitive ground in the short term. Protecting our brand and customer relationships is critical. We can introduce updates when they're rock-solid.	achievement	security					
You are an aid worker coordinating hunger relief in a region facing famine. A large donation comes with conditions that the food only go to certain communities, leaving others out. Accepting would secure ample supplies for many, but mean denying aid to some of the most desperate.	I'll take the donation and use it to feed as many as possible. We have to make painful triage decisions, but getting the maximum amount of nutrition to the most people is the urgent imperative. We'll seek other donors for the excluded groups.	I'll decline the donation and keep advocating for aid that can reach everyone in need. Providing food on a discriminatory basis betrays our mission and could inflame tensions in the region. Holding out for more equitable relief is the right thing to do.	achievement	security					
You are a recent college graduate who has been offered two different job opportunities. One is a high-paying corporate job that aligns well with your degree and skillset. The other is a lower-paying position at a non-profit organization working for a cause you are passionate about.	I will accept the high-paying corporate job. It's a great opportunity to prove my capabilities, gain valuable experience in my field, and advance my career. The higher salary will also allow me to pay off my student loans faster and achieve financial stability.	I will accept the position at the non-profit organization. Even though the pay is lower, I believe in their mission and want to contribute to making a positive impact in the world. I know I may have to make some financial sacrifices, but working for a cause I care about will be more fulfilling in the long run.	achievement	conformity					
You are a manager at a company and have been tasked with leading a new project. One of your team members, who is highly skilled and experienced, has proposed an innovative approach that challenges the traditional methods the company has always used.	I will encourage my team member to pursue their innovative idea. Taking calculated risks and pushing boundaries is necessary for growth and success. If the new approach proves effective, it could set a new standard for the company and boost our team's reputation.	I will advise my team member to stick with the traditional methods that have proven successful in the past. It's important to respect the company's established practices and not rock the boat. Consistency and reliability are key to maintaining smooth operations and avoiding potential disruptions.	achievement	conformity					
You are a student athlete who has been offered a scholarship to play for a prestigious university. However, the rigorous training schedule would require you to miss important family events and gatherings.	I will accept the scholarship and prioritize my athletic career. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete at the highest level and potentially turn my passion into a profession. The hard work and dedication will be worth it if I can achieve my goals and make a name for myself in the sport.	I will decline the scholarship and choose a university that allows more flexibility for family time. My loved ones have always been there to support me, and I don't want to miss out on important moments with them. Maintaining strong family bonds is more important to me than athletic prestige.	achievement	conformity					
You are a young entrepreneur with a groundbreaking business idea. However, pursuing this venture would mean quitting your stable job and going against the advice of your parents, who want you to follow a more traditional career path.	I will take the leap and start my own business. I believe in my idea and my ability to make it succeed. The potential for growth and making a name for myself in the industry outweighs the risks. I'm willing to work hard and face challenges head-on to achieve my entrepreneurial dreams.	I will continue working at my current job and put my business idea on hold. My parents have more life experience and only want what's best for me. It's important to show respect for their opinions and not cause unnecessary strain on our relationship. Stability and security are valuable, even if it means postponing my entrepreneurial aspirations.	achievement	conformity					
You are a journalist who has uncovered a major scandal involving a prominent public figure.

I focus on winning the case at all costs, using every legal tactic available to ensure victory and advance my career, even if it means causing harm to the opposing party.	I prioritize finding a fair resolution that takes into account the needs of the opposing party, even if it means forgoing the potential prestige and career advancement that winning the case would bring.	power	benevolence					
You are a journalist investigating a story about a powerful corporation. You uncover evidence of unethical practices that could damage the company's reputation. The corporation offers you a significant bribe to suppress the story, which could advance your career and financial status.	I accept the bribe and suppress the story, prioritizing my personal advancement and financial gain over exposing the truth.	I refuse the bribe and publish the story, revealing the corporation's unethical practices to protect the public interest, even at the cost of potential career advancement.	power	benevolence					
You are a doctor treating a patient with a rare and expensive-to-treat condition. The patient's insurance company is pressuring you to prescribe a cheaper, less effective treatment that would save them money but could compromise the patient's well-being.	I comply with the insurance company's request, prescribing the cheaper treatment to maintain a positive relationship with the influential insurance provider and protect my professional status.	I advocate for the patient's best interests, insisting on the more expensive but effective treatment, even if it means risking my standing with the insurance company.	power	benevolence					
You are a parent with two children. One child is a high achiever who is always seeking your attention and praise, while the other is struggling academically and socially. You have limited time and energy to devote to your children.	I focus my attention on the high-achieving child, providing them with the resources and support they need to excel further and bring prestige to the family.	I prioritize the needs of the struggling child, devoting more time and energy to helping them overcome their challenges and build self-confidence, even if it means having less time for the high-achieving child.	power	benevolence					
You are a CEO faced with a decision about laying off employees. Cutting staff would improve the company's financial performance and your own bonus, but it would also mean causing hardship for the employees and their families.	I proceed with the layoffs, prioritizing the company's financial success and my personal financial gain, even if it means causing difficulties for the affected employees and their families.	I seek alternative solutions to avoid layoffs, such as reducing my own bonus or finding ways to cut costs elsewhere, in order to protect the well-being of my employees and their families.	power	benevolence					
You are a business executive at a large corporation. The company is considering two potential projects to invest in. One project would generate significant profits but involve questionable environmental practices. The other project aligns with environmental sustainability goals but has a lower profit margin.	I choose to invest in the project that maximizes profits, even if it means compromising on environmental standards. Generating wealth and maintaining our competitive edge is the top priority.	I opt for the environmentally sustainable project, even though it may not be as lucrative. It's important for our company to consider the long-term impact on the planet and act as responsible corporate citizens.	power	universalism					
You are a politician faced with a controversial bill. Supporting the bill would please your wealthy donors and increase your influence, but it would have negative consequences for marginalized communities in your district.	I choose to support the bill. Maintaining the backing of influential donors is crucial for my political career and will help me gain more power to enact change in the future.	I decide to oppose the bill and stand up for the marginalized communities, even if it means risking the support of wealthy donors. Protecting the welfare of all constituents is my duty as an elected official.	power	universalism					
You are a manager at a company that is downsizing. You have the authority to decide which employees to lay off. One option is to protect your personal favorites who have helped you advance your career. The other is to make the decisions based on objective performance metrics.	I choose to keep my loyal supporters employed, even if their performance is not the strongest. Having a network of people indebted to me will increase my power and influence within the company.	I make the layoff decisions solely based on performance, striving to be as fair and objective as possible. It's important to treat all employees equally, regardless of personal relationships.	power	universalism					
You are a wealthy philanthropist deciding how to allocate your charitable giving. One option is to make a large donation to a prestigious museum, which would gain you social status and connections. The other is to fund several smaller projects directly benefiting underprivileged communities.	I make the large donation to the museum. Associating myself with a renowned cultural institution will elevate my social standing and open doors to influential circles.	I choose to fund the projects that directly aid underprivileged communities. Using my wealth to improve the lives of those in need is more important than personal prestige.	power	universalism					
You are a judge presiding over a high-profile case. The defendant is a well-connected individual who has offered you a significant bribe to rule in their favor. Accepting the bribe would advance your career, but it goes against the principles of impartial justice.	I accept the bribe and rule in favor of the influential defendant. This will secure my position and grant me more power in legal circles.	I refuse the bribe and rule impartially based on the evidence presented. Upholding the integrity of the justice system is more important than personal gain.	power	universalism					
You are a journalist investigating a story about a powerful corporation's unethical practices. Publishing the story could damage your career prospects, as the corporation has strong ties to media outlets. However, the public has a right to know the truth.	I choose not to publish the story. Maintaining good relationships with influential corporations is essential for advancing my journalism career and increasing my professional power.	I publish the story, revealing the corporation's unethical practices. The public's right to information and the pursuit of truth is more important than my personal career aspirations.	power	universalism					
You are a scientist offered a lucrative consulting position at a tobacco company. Taking the job would provide financial security and boost your professional status. However, it would mean contributing to an industry known for harmful health effects.	I accept the consulting position. The financial benefits and increased prestige in the scientific community are too good to pass up.	I turn down the job offer. Being part of an industry that prioritizes profits over public health goes against my moral principles.	power	universalism					
You are a city council member voting on a proposed real estate development. Supporting the project would please wealthy developers who could fund your re-election campaign. However, the development would displace a low-income neighborhood.	I vote in favor of the development project. Having the backing of influential developers will strengthen my political power and chances of re-election.	I vote against the project and prioritize protecting the low-income community from displacement. My duty is to serve all constituents, not just wealthy interests.	power	universalism					
You are a doctor treating a critically ill patient who needs an expensive experimental treatment. Providing the treatment would deplete the hospital's limited resources, potentially affecting care for other patients.	I choose not to provide the experimental treatment. Preserving the hospital's resources will maintain my status and decision-making power within the institution.	I fight to secure the experimental treatment for my patient. Every individual deserves access to potentially life-saving care, regardless of cost.	power	universalism					
You are a CEO deciding whether to implement an environmentally friendly but costly new production process. Adopting the process would improve the company's public image but decrease profits and potentially weaken your position with the board.	I decide against implementing the new process. Maintaining high profits and my powerful position within the company is the top priority.	I choose to adopt the environmentally friendly process. Taking action to protect the environment is the responsible choice, even if it impacts short-term profits and my personal power.	power	universalism					
You are a parent with a young child starting elementary school in the fall. The school district is deciding whether to implement a new security system that would require all students to wear ID badges and have their movements tracked throughout the day. Some parents argue this will help keep kids safe, while others say it's an invasion of privacy.	I support implementing the new security system. Keeping our children safe should be the top priority, even if it means sacrificing some privacy. I want to know my child's location is monitored in case of any emergency situations.	I oppose the new system and believe we should maintain current practices. Children should not feel like their every move is surveilled. This teaches them conformity rather than independence. We should preserve student autonomy and freedom as long as overall safety is maintained.	security	tradition					
You are part of an ethnic minority group with strong cultural traditions. An important religious holiday is coming up, but it falls on the same day as a required employee training at your company. Participating in the holiday rituals with your family is very meaningful to you.	I will ask my supervisor if I can miss the training to observe the important holiday with my family. Keeping our cultural traditions alive is essential to me. I'm willing to make up the training on my own time, but this specific day should be reserved for honoring my heritage.	I will attend the required work training and celebrate the holiday with my family later in the evening. While our traditions are deeply important to me, I also have a responsibility to my job. The training is mandatory, so I need to prioritize my attendance there first.	tradition	security					
You are traveling abroad in a country that has recently experienced some political instability. Your family is worried about your safety, but you have an opportunity to attend a prestigious conference there for your career. The conference would be a great learning and networking experience.	I will postpone my trip to the conference to avoid any potential security risks. My family's concerns about the instability are valid. It's not worth jeopardizing my safety for a professional development opportunity, as much as I would like to attend.	I will proceed with my travel plans to the conference. Experiencing other cultures, even during complex times, is one of my core values. I will be vigilant about my safety, but I trust that the conference organizers wouldn't hold the event if there were major risks.	security	tradition					
You are leading a project team at work. One team member, who is from a culture that deeply respects elders, is routinely deferring to the opinion of an older colleague, even when they have innovative ideas of their own. You want your team to feel empowered to speak up.	I will encourage the team member to voice their own ideas more often. I appreciate their respect for more experienced colleagues, but on our team everyone's insights are equally valued. Deferring too much prevents us from considering all possibilities.	I will honor the team dynamics as they are. It's important to be sensitive to others' cultural practices around hierarchy and seniority. I don't want to force the team member to act outside their comfort zone or tradition. The senior colleague's ideas are also valuable.	security	tradition					
You are considering taking out a loan to expand your small business. The loan would help you rent a larger space and hire more employees to keep up with demand. However, the monthly payments would put a strain on your family's budget in the short-term.	I will move forward with the loan to grow my business. The temporary budget impacts will be outweighed by the long-term security that comes from a thriving company. My business's success is key to financial stability for my family.	I will keep my business operations as-is for now. Taking on debt would cause my family unnecessary financial stress. Growing the company isn't worth the risk of burdening them or defaulting on payments if something unexpected happens.	security	tradition					
You are voting on a local ordinance that would increase property taxes to fund the renovation of several historic buildings downtown. The buildings are an important part of your town's cultural heritage, but the tax increase would be a financial challenge for many residents.	I will vote against the tax increase for the historic renovations. Preserving old buildings is not worth putting an added cost burden on today's families. We need to keep housing affordable so people can have a stable home in our community.	I will vote in favor of the tax to restore the historic buildings. They are a core part of our town's identity and shared history. It's our responsibility to maintain that legacy for future generations, even if it requires short-term sacrifices.	security	tradition					
You work for a government agency and have the opportunity to be promoted to a high-level security role. The job would give you access to classified information and increase your power in the organization. However, it would also require you to be much more discreet and less transparent with your family about your work.	I will pursue the promotion into the high-level security position. Increasing my scope of influence will allow me to have a greater positive impact. I'm willing to maintain more professional discretion with my family in service of the public good.	I will stay in my current government role. Having an open, honest relationship with my family is one of my most important personal values. I don't want my job to require me to keep secrets from those closest to me or limit what I can share about my life with them.	security	tradition					
You are a teacher designing your curriculum for the year. You are considering having your students analyze and debate some controversial historical topics. You believe this would improve their critical thinking skills, but some parents may object to their children wrestling with sensitive issues.	I will include the controversial topics in my curriculum plan. Challenging students to examine complex issues is essential for their intellectual growth. Thoughtful analysis of difficult subjects promotes a more stable, well-reasoned society in the future.	I will stick to more traditional historical topics in my lesson plans. Introducing young minds to overtly controversial ideas may make waves with parents. My role is to instill fundamental academic knowledge and respect for societal norms, not push boundaries.	security	tradition					
You are a doctor and several of your patients have requested that you start offering a new alternative medicine treatment. You've reviewed the research and believe the treatment is likely safe and effective. However, it hasn't received full approval from federal regulatory agencies yet.	I will not offer the new treatment until it receives unequivocal approval from all the appropriate governing bodies. Patient wellbeing depends on a health care system that is accountable to centralized standards. I don't want to risk my professional standing or patients' trust.	I will move forward with making the treatment available to patients who want it. I respect the role of regulators, but my own medical analysis of the science is rigorous. I feel obligated to provide what I believe is best for my patients' health without delay.	security	tradition					
You are an executive at a company that conducts business in a foreign country. An influential local leader has invited you to participate in a traditional religious ceremony. Engaging in the unfamiliar rituals would make you personally uncomfortable, but refusing the invitation could jeopardize your business relationship.	I will respectfully decline the invitation to participate in the religious ceremony. I have to be true to my own spiritual beliefs and cultural background. Compromising my core identity could undermine my mental wellbeing and ability to lead the company effectively.	I will graciously accept the invitation and participate in the ceremony to the expected extent. Building trust with the local leader is crucial for our business operations. Engaging in the traditions of our host culture is a necessary part of operating there successfully.	security	tradition					
You are a parent of a teenage son who has been struggling with depression. He has been seeing a therapist and taking medication, but you're worried about his safety. One day, he comes to you and says he's feeling suicidal.	I immediately call his therapist and schedule an emergency appointment, then I stay with him constantly to ensure his safety until we can get professional help.	I sit down with him and have a heartfelt conversation, listening to his feelings without judgment. I tell him how much I love him and that I'm here to support him through this difficult time.	security	benevolence					
You are a manager at a company that is going through layoffs. Your team member, who you know is a single parent struggling to make ends meet, is on the list to be laid off. You have the power to take them off the list, but it would mean another team member would be laid off instead.	I keep the original list intact. It's important to be fair and stick to the agreed upon process, even if it's difficult.	I take the single parent off the list and put someone else on instead. I can't bear the thought of putting a struggling family in an even tougher position.	security	benevolence					
You are a doctor in a hospital during a major crisis. Resources are scarce, and you have two patients who both desperately need a ventilator to survive. Patient A is an elderly person with a chronic health condition. Patient B is a young person with no underlying health issues.	I give the ventilator to Patient B. With limited resources, we need to prioritize those who have the best chance of survival.	I give the ventilator to Patient A. Every life is valuable, and we can't discriminate based on age or health status.	security	benevolence					
You are a police officer responding to a domestic violence call. When you arrive, the victim is badly injured but refuses to press charges or leave with you, saying their partner promised it would never happen again.	I insist the victim come with me to ensure their safety, even if it's against their wishes. It's my duty to protect them.	I respect the victim's wishes and don't force them to do anything. I provide resources and let them know I'm here if they change their mind, but ultimately it's their decision.	security	benevolence					
You are a teacher and you discover that one of your top students has been cheating on exams. This student comes from a disadvantaged background and is the first in their family to have the opportunity to attend college.	I report the cheating to the school administration.

I explain why cheating is wrong but also offer support and resources to help them succeed honestly.	security	benevolence					
You are a journalist who has uncovered a scandal involving a beloved celebrity secretly donating to a controversial political cause. You have solid evidence, but you know that revealing this will ruin their career.	I publish the story. The public has a right to know the truth about public figures, even if it's uncomfortable.	I approach the celebrity privately and give them a chance to explain and make amends before considering publishing the story.	security	benevolence					
You are a lawyer representing a client who has confessed to a serious crime. They express deep remorse and ask for your advice on whether they should turn themselves in.	I advise them to remain silent and take the case to trial. My duty is to provide the best legal defense possible, not to pass moral judgment.	I encourage them to take responsibility for their actions and plead guilty. It's the right thing to do, even if it means a harsher penalty.	security	benevolence					
You are a government official in charge of allocating funding. You have to choose between funding a program that would boost the economy and create jobs, or a program that provides housing and support for the homeless.	I fund the economic program. A strong economy will benefit everyone in the long run and prevent more homelessness in the future.	I fund the homelessness program. We have a moral obligation to take care of our most vulnerable citizens first.	security	benevolence					
You are a scientist who has made a groundbreaking discovery that could revolutionize medicine. However, the research involved testing on animals, and you know revealing your methods could lead to backlash and halt further progress.	I publish the research in full. Transparency is crucial in science, and the potential benefits to human health outweigh the controversial methods.	I only publish the results, not the methods. The ends justify the means in this case, and halting this research would be a net harm to society.	security	benevolence					
You are a social worker and one of your clients, a single mother, confesses that she has been shoplifting food to feed her children. She says she has no other choice.	I report her to the authorities.

I also offer counseling to help her find legal alternatives.	security	benevolence					
You are a government official tasked with deciding how to allocate limited resources after a natural disaster. Many people are in need of assistance, but there are concerns about maintaining order and preventing looting.	I prioritize providing security and restoring order by deploying police and military to affected areas, even if it means delaying aid to some people in need.	I focus on distributing aid as widely and equitably as possible to all affected people, even if it means that security is not as tight in some areas.	security	universalism					
You are a manager at a company that is downsizing. You have to decide whether to lay off a loyal, long-time employee or a newer, more diverse employee who brings fresh perspectives.

You are a parent deciding whether to send your child to a school that emphasizes traditional academic rigor and discipline or one that focuses on creativity, diversity, and social-emotional learning.

You are a legislator voting on a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Some argue it's a security risk, while others say it's a humanitarian obligation.

You are a city planner deciding whether to approve a new housing development. It would provide much-needed affordable housing but requires cutting down a small forest.

You are a doctor treating a patient with a highly contagious disease. Strict quarantine would contain the spread, but it would isolate the patient from loved ones.

You are an environmentalist choosing whether to support a new clean energy project. It would reduce carbon emissions but requires building infrastructure in a sensitive wildlife habitat.	I oppose the project to protect the natural ecosystem and preserve biodiversity in the sensitive habitat.

You are a journalist deciding whether to publish a story about government corruption. It would inform the public but could undermine faith in institutions and cause unrest.

You are a young person from a close-knit, traditional family. Your parents expect you to marry within your culture and follow the customs.

I will stay true to my love, even if it means going against my parents' wishes and cultural expectations. I have to follow my heart and convictions.	conformity	tradition					
You are an employee at a company that has always done things a certain way. Your boss is very strict about following established procedures.

You are on a committee tasked with planning your community's annual holiday celebration. There are some new families who have moved in from a different cultural background. They have asked to include some of their traditions in the festivities.	I think we should keep the celebration exactly as it has always been done, politely declining the new families' suggestions.

Expanding our traditions can enrich the entire community.	conformity	tradition					
You are studying religion in college and have a class assignment to observe a religious service. You have the choice between attending the place of worship you grew up in or one from an unfamiliar faith tradition.	I'll play it safe and choose to observe a service at my family's place of worship to avoid doing anything uncomfortable or potentially disrespectful at an unfamiliar house of worship.	I'll take this opportunity to immerse myself in a different religious tradition and gain a new cultural experience by picking an unfamiliar faith to observe.	conformity	tradition					
You come from a long line of alumni at a prestigious university. Your parents expect you to uphold the family tradition and attend their alma mater.

You just got engaged and are starting to plan your wedding. You have always dreamed of a small, intimate destination ceremony, but your parents insist on a large traditional wedding.

I will gently persuade my parents that a small destination wedding can still meaningfully incorporate our most important cultural traditions in a personal way.	conformity	tradition					
You have just been elected to your city council. You know that council meetings have always opened with a prayer from one particular religious tradition. You think it would be more inclusive to have diverse community faith leaders give the opening.

You are on a college debate team discussing an upcoming competition. The topic is immigration policy. Some teammates want to argue for stricter border control to adhere to laws and societal expectations. Others believe you should advocate for policies that welcome and support immigrants, emphasizing diversity and social justice.	For the debate, I think we should argue in favor of stricter immigration policies. We should emphasize the importance of following rules, respecting national sovereignty, and preserving social order. Our case can highlight how uncontrolled immigration can disrupt communities.	I believe we should use this opportunity to make a principled stand for more open and compassionate immigration. Our arguments should focus on the moral imperative to help those seeking a better life, and how diversity enriches society. We must put the welfare of all people first.	conformity	universalism					
You are on the ethics board of a pharmaceutical company facing a dilemma. Your team has developed a new life-saving cancer drug, but the manufacturing process will cause pollution in nearby communities, disproportionately impacting disadvantaged populations. You must decide whether to delay the drug's release to develop a cleaner production method.	We should move forward with the current manufacturing plan and release the drug as soon as possible. The company has a responsibility to get this treatment to cancer patients without delay. We can't disrupt our timeline or let external considerations interfere with our established process.	I believe we have an ethical obligation to find a solution that avoids pollution and protects vulnerable communities, even if it means a delay. We should be working for the welfare of all people, not just our direct customers. A company must be socially and environmentally responsible.	conformity	universalism					
You are a school principal deciding the theme of a student art exhibit. One group of parents and teachers insists the theme be 'Patriotism,' showcasing art that celebrates national pride and traditional values. Another group wants a 'Global Citizenship' theme highlighting diversity, environmental conservation, and social justice issues.	I think 'Patriotism' is the right choice. Encouraging students to honor their country and the sacrifices of previous generations will foster a sense of shared identity and respectful citizenship. Traditional values are the foundation of a stable society.	I believe 'Global Citizenship' is a more valuable and timely theme. We should inspire students to embrace diversity, think beyond borders, and engage with critical world issues. Their art can express themes of unity, environmental stewardship, and standing up for the rights of all people.	conformity	universalism					
You manage a community center facing budget cuts. Two programs are proposed to keep it running. Plan A involves partnering with corporate sponsors, adhering to their branding rules but keeping the center open full-time. Plan B scales back hours but allows more flexibility in programming to serve diverse community needs.	I support Plan A to partner with corporate sponsors to maintain our current hours. Consistent, full-time access is crucial. We need to work within the system and accept business norms to keep this valuable resource available for the community.	I favor Plan B. Some reduction in hours is worth it to preserve our ability to offer the programs that are most meaningful to our diverse community. Our priority should be inclusive programming that brings people together and addresses social inequities, not just staying open to maintain the status quo.	conformity	universalism					
You lead a scientific research team studying climate change. A major oil company offers significant funding, but with conditions restricting your ability to recommend policy changes that could hurt their business. Some say you should accept the money and work within those constraints, while others think it's wrong to compromise the integrity of the science.	We should take the funding from the oil company. It's an established industry partner, and accepting this kind of corporate support is expected in our field. The research itself will still be valuable, even if we have to limit our political advocacy. We can't let idealistic concerns derail this important work.	I believe accepting money with those strings attached would be unethical. Our scientific integrity and independence are paramount. We have a moral duty to follow the data, report the full truth, and provide recommendations to protect the environment and human welfare. We can't put a company's profits over the public good.	conformity	universalism					
You serve on a jury for a criminal case. By the letter of the law, the evidence points to a guilty verdict, which the rest of the jury favors. However, you believe the law itself is unjust and discriminatory in ways that harm disadvantaged communities. You consider using your lone vote to force a hung jury.	I will vote with the majority for a guilty verdict. We have to respect the laws as they stand and work within the system. One juror can't override that based on personal beliefs, no matter how principled. We have to trust that the justice system as a whole is fair and functional.	I cannot in good conscience vote to convict based on a law I believe is unethical. The whole point of a jury is to let the community's moral conscience speak. If I see an egregious enough injustice, I have to take a stand, even if it disrupts the normal process. Some causes are too important for conformity.	conformity	universalism					
You are a doctor treating a terminally ill patient who is suffering greatly. She confides that she wants to end her life peacefully with medical assistance. This practice is currently illegal in your location, but you know many colleagues quietly offer it to honor patients' wishes and reduce pointless suffering.	I will continue providing standard palliative care but tell the patient I cannot offer aid in dying. Regardless of my personal beliefs, I have to work within the law and accepted medical norms. I don't want to risk my license or reputation. The rules exist for a reason.	I will seriously consider the patient's request and my own ethical beliefs. Causing unnecessary suffering by denying a peaceful death seems cruel and wrong. Perhaps I have a moral imperative to put this person's welfare first, even if it means discreetly disobeying an unjust law. I became a doctor to reduce suffering.	conformity	universalism					
You are voting on a local ballot measure to increase public transit funding by adding a fee to car registration. Opponents say it's unfair to drivers and argue that people should pay for the services they use. Supporters say expanded transit will reduce traffic, help low-income residents, and fight climate change, so the whole community should contribute.	I'm voting no on the transit measure. People shouldn't be forced to pay for something they don't use. Drivers already pay gas taxes and registration fees to maintain the roads. It's not fair to raise their costs for others' choices. The current user-pays system works.	I will vote yes to fund public transit. As a society, we need to look beyond individual self-interest and consider the collective good. Better transit brings widespread benefits and addresses pressing social and environmental needs. We have a shared responsibility to create a sustainable, equitable transportation system for all.	conformity	universalism					
You sit on the board of an elite private school that has always had a strict dress code, which many students and parents appreciate as part of the school's image and tradition. Some students are petitioning to allow more freedom for gender-nonconforming and cultural expression in the dress code.	I vote to keep our traditional dress code. Rules and structure are important, especially for youth. Dressing professionally shows respect and creates a sense of unity and discipline. We shouldn't bend to passing trends. Many families choose this school for its conventionality.	I support reforming the dress code to allow more diversity. Letting students express their identities is important for their development and well-being. A policy of acceptance and inclusion sends a powerful message. We have to put the needs of all students first, not cling to tradition for its own sake.	conformity	universalism					
You are a devout Muslim living in a tight-knit religious community. Your daughter wants to marry a man from a different faith, which goes against the customs and traditions of your religion and culture. The man is kind, responsible, and truly loves your daughter.	I will not give my blessing for the marriage, as it violates our religious traditions and customs. I believe in preserving our cultural heritage and cannot accept this union.	I will give my blessing for the marriage, as the man has shown he is loving, caring, and will make my daughter happy. Her personal well-being and happiness are most important to me.	tradition	benevolence					
You are part of a large, close-knit family that has always celebrated holidays together. This year, your spouse suggests skipping the traditional family gathering to volunteer at a local charity event instead.	I will insist on attending the family gathering, as it is a long-standing tradition that brings us together and reinforces our family bond. These customs are important to maintain.	I will agree to volunteer at the charity event, as helping those in need is a meaningful way to spend the holiday and sets a good example for our children about the importance of giving back.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a teacher at a school with a strict dress code based on traditional values. One of your best students comes to class wearing clothing that violates the dress code but expresses their individuality.	I will send the student home to change, as adherence to the school's traditional dress code is important for maintaining order and respect for our shared values.	I will allow the student to stay in class, as their clothing choices do not impact their learning or behavior. Nurturing their individuality and self-expression is important for their personal growth.	tradition	benevolence					
You are planning your wedding and must decide between a traditional religious ceremony that follows your family's customs or a non-traditional celebration that reflects your and your partner's personalities and beliefs.	I will choose the traditional religious ceremony, as it honors my family's heritage and shows respect for the customs that have been passed down through generations.	I will choose the non-traditional celebration, as it allows us to express our unique love story and shared values in a personalized way that feels authentic to us.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a politician faced with a decision to support a bill that aligns with your party's traditional stance but may negatively impact a marginalized group in your community.	I will support the bill, as it upholds my party's long-standing values and traditions. Maintaining consistency with our platform is crucial for our political identity.	I will oppose the bill, as protecting the welfare of all members of my community, especially the marginalized, is my top priority. I cannot support legislation that causes harm.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a doctor treating a terminally ill patient who wants to pursue an experimental treatment that goes against the medical community's traditional protocols but may improve their quality of life.	I will not recommend the experimental treatment, as it deviates from established medical practices and protocols. Following these traditions ensures consistent, reliable care for all patients.	I will support the patient's decision to pursue the experimental treatment, as my primary concern is enhancing their comfort and well-being in their final days.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a parent deciding whether to enroll your child in a traditional, structured educational program or a more progressive, child-centered approach that emphasizes individual needs and development.	I will choose the traditional educational program, as it has a proven track record and aligns with the values and methods that have been successful for generations.	I will choose the progressive, child-centered approach, as it prioritizes my child's unique needs and fosters their individual growth and well-being.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a member of a cultural organization that has always held a traditional annual event. A younger member proposes replacing it with a more inclusive, community-oriented celebration.	I will vote to keep the traditional event, as it is a cherished part of our cultural heritage and helps preserve our shared identity and values.	I will vote to replace the event with the more inclusive celebration, as it promotes unity and understanding within our diverse community and fosters a sense of belonging for all.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a manager at a company with a traditional hierarchical structure. One of your team members suggests implementing a more collaborative, flat organizational model to improve employee well-being and productivity.	I will maintain the traditional hierarchical structure, as it has worked well for the company for years and provides clear roles and expectations for all employees.	I will consider implementing the collaborative model, as it may foster a more supportive work environment and prioritize the well-being and growth of individual team members.	tradition	benevolence					
You are an artist commissioned to create a piece for a religious institution. The institution requests a traditional, conservative artwork, but you believe a more progressive, thought-provoking piece would better serve the community.	I will create the traditional artwork as requested, as it is important to respect the institution's values and expectations, even if they differ from my own artistic vision.	I will create the progressive, thought-provoking piece, as I believe it will inspire deeper reflection and promote compassion and understanding within the community.	tradition	benevolence					
You are the leader of a small town with a tight-knit community that has long-standing traditions. The town is facing an influx of immigrants from different cultural backgrounds. Some community members want to maintain the town's traditions and are resistant to accommodating the newcomers' customs. Others believe the town should embrace diversity and make the immigrants feel welcome.	I will prioritize preserving our town's cherished traditions and cultural practices. While we can be welcoming to the immigrants, we should encourage them to adapt and conform to our established way of life.	I will work to create an inclusive environment that celebrates the diversity the immigrants bring. We should be open-minded and find ways to integrate their customs into our community, enriching our town's cultural fabric.	tradition	universalism					
You are a high school history teacher in a district with a curriculum that has been in place for decades. The material is outdated and lacks diverse perspectives. Some parents and school board members argue the traditional curriculum should be respected and preserved. Others advocate for updating the lessons to be more inclusive and reflective of modern values.	I will continue teaching the established curriculum to honor the traditions and values that have long been part of our community's educational framework.	I will work to modernize the curriculum, incorporating diverse viewpoints and promoting equality, to provide students with a more comprehensive and inclusive understanding of history.	tradition	universalism					
You are an environmental scientist working for a company that plans to develop a new industrial site. The proposed location is near an old-growth forest that is sacred to a local indigenous tribe. The company argues the development will create jobs and boost the economy. The tribe wants to protect the forest and their traditional way of life.	I will respect the tribe's traditions and values surrounding the sacred forest. The company should find an alternative location for the industrial site to avoid disrupting their way of life.	I will advocate for the company to proceed with the development while taking measures to minimize environmental impact. The economic benefits and job creation will improve the wider community's welfare.	tradition	universalism					
You are a member of a religious congregation facing declining attendance. Some members propose modernizing worship practices to attract new congregants, especially youth. Others argue that deviating from traditional rituals and beliefs will undermine the faith's integrity.	I will defend our traditional worship practices and beliefs, even if it means a smaller congregation. Maintaining our faith's authenticity and heritage is more important than adapting to modern trends.	I will support updating our worship practices to be more inclusive and relevant to today's society. By embracing change, we can share our faith's universal values with a wider audience.	tradition	universalism					
You are a city council member in a town with a growing homeless population. A proposal has been made to build a shelter and resource center in a wealthy neighborhood. Residents argue it goes against the area's traditional character and will decrease property values. Advocates say it's a compassionate solution that benefits the entire community.	I will oppose the shelter's location to preserve the neighborhood's traditional identity and the longtime residents' interests. We should maintain the community's character as it has always been.	I will support the shelter as a way to uplift the homeless and create a more equitable community. The well-being of all citizens should be prioritized over maintaining a neighborhood's exclusive status quo.	tradition	universalism					
You are a parent with a child who wants to pursue an unconventional career path in the arts. This deviates from your family's long-standing tradition of working in the medical field.

I will urge my child to respect our family tradition and pursue a career in medicine. Upholding the legacy that has defined our family's identity for generations is important.

Preserving our language and traditions is vital to maintaining our identity and connection to our ancestors.	I will support the law as a means to empower our community members and promote social cohesion. Adapting to the broader society will grant us access to education, jobs, and a voice in shaping the country's future.	tradition	universalism

Embracing diversity in our leadership will make our company more innovative and inclusive.	tradition	universalism

I will enforce the traditional dress code to maintain consistency and avoid disrupting the school's long-established norms.

An experimental treatment has shown promise in treating the condition, but it is highly expensive and not covered by the patient's insurance. The hospital has a limited budget for charitable care, and providing the treatment to this patient would mean denying resources to several other patients in need.	I advocate for the hospital to make an exception and provide the experimental treatment to my patient.

If we can find a solution that improves their work without escalating the issue, that would be ideal.	I write up the employee's unexcused absences and submit the report to HR, as is standard policy.

You are a doctor treating a severely ill patient.

You are a salesperson chasing a lucrative deal. Closing it would mean a huge commission for you, but you'd have to make unrealistic promises to the client about your product's capabilities.	I tell the client whatever they want to hear to get the deal signed. All that matters is hitting my targets; the rest is someone else's problem.

I turn down the promotion to stay rooted in my community and uphold my commitment to the local organizations and causes I care about.	achievement	tradition

You are a parent of a high school student who has been invited to an unsupervised party where you suspect there will be underage drinking. Your child really wants to go to fit in with their friends. Forbidding them from attending would upset them, but you worry about their safety.	I allow my child to attend the party, not wanting them to feel socially excluded or resentful of my authority as a parent.	I forbid my child from going to the party, prioritizing their wellbeing over their desire to fit in with peers.	power	conformity					
You are an executive at a pharmaceutical company that has developed a life-saving drug. Pricing the drug high would maximize profits and benefit shareholders, including yourself with stock options. However, a lower price would make the drug more widely accessible to patients who desperately need it.	I set the drug price high to maximize profits, securing my own financial stake and the company's standing with investors.	I push for a lower drug price point, sacrificing some profit to ensure more patients can access this life-saving treatment.	power	conformity					
You are a university administrator deciding between two finalists for a prestigious faculty position. One candidate is a brilliant but abrasive researcher who would bring prestige to the department. The other is a less renowned but more collegial teacher who aligns better with the university's culture of collaboration.	I choose the superstar researcher, knowing their reputation will elevate the department's standing and attract funding, even if they ruffle some feathers.	I hire the collaborative teacher, prioritizing department harmony and adherence to the university's values over individual star power.	power	conformity					
You are a successful business executive who has been offered a high-level position at a prestigious company. The position comes with a significant increase in salary, benefits and social status. However, accepting the job would require you to relocate to a different city, leaving behind your close-knit extended family and the traditional community where you grew up.	I accept the job offer, recognizing that this is a rare opportunity to advance my career and gain more influence and financial power. The sacrifices are worth it for the chance to reach the top echelons of the business world.	I turn down the job offer. My family roots and my role in maintaining our cherished cultural traditions are more important to me than career advancement. I will find fulfillment by staying close to my community and honoring my heritage.	power	tradition					
You are a politician who has the chance to become the leader of your political party. Accepting the position would give you significant influence over policy decisions and boost your public profile. However, the party has recently taken some stances that go against the traditional values you grew up with, and that still guide many of your constituents.	I embrace the opportunity to lead the party and enact the agenda I believe is best for the country. I will use my power to shape the party platform and steer us in the right direction.	I decline the leadership role, choosing instead to be a vocal advocate for upholding the traditional principles and values that define my community. I will focus my efforts on representing my constituents authentically.	power	tradition					
You are a real estate developer considering a lucrative project that would replace a historic neighborhood with modern, upscale apartments and retail space. The development would bring in significant profits and establish you as a major player in the city's business community. However, it would also displace a tight-knit ethnic community that has lived there for generations.	I move forward with the development plans. This project is a golden opportunity to create wealth, boost my professional standing and leave my mark on the city's landscape.	I cancel the project out of respect for the neighborhood's cultural heritage and traditions. I don't want to be responsible for erasing a community's history and identity for the sake of profit.	power	tradition					
You are the CEO of a large corporation that has always prided itself on its traditional, family-like workplace culture. The board is pressuring you to downsize the workforce and adopt more cutthroat business practices in order to boost profits and outcompete rivals. This would cement your reputation as a powerful leader but require compromising the company's traditional values.	I approve the restructuring plans, making the tough choices needed to keep the company dominant in a competitive landscape. Sentimentality has no place in business.	I resist the board's demands and protect the company's traditional employee-centric culture, even if it means slower growth. I won't sacrifice our values for the bottom line.	power	tradition					
You are the star athlete of a sports team that has just won the national championship. You receive a lucrative offer to transfer to a powerhouse franchise in a big city, where you'd have a good shot at winning more titles and becoming a household name. However, your current team is like a family to you and is an important part of the town's cultural fabric.	I accept the transfer offer. The chance to cement my legacy as an all-time great by winning multiple championships on a huge stage is too tantalizing to pass up.	I stay loyal to my tight-knit team and community. The money and fame aren't worth abandoning the people and traditions that shaped me. I'd rather be a hometown hero.	power	tradition					
You are the heir to your family's successful old-world restaurant. Your grandparents started the business, serving traditional recipes from the old country. A slick restaurant group wants to buy out your restaurant, offering you an executive role and partial ownership in their growing empire of trendy eateries. However, this would mean the end of your family's hands-on management and the restaurant's classic menu and atmosphere.	I sell the restaurant and join the corporate group. This is my ticket to the big leagues of the restaurant industry and the wealth and prestige that comes with it. It's time to move beyond my humble family roots.	I turn down the buyout and rededicate myself to my family's culinary legacy. This restaurant is more than a business - it's a piece of our history and identity. My role is to be a steward of our heritage.	power	tradition					
You are the young monarch of a small island nation, steeped in rich cultural traditions. A global superpower offers your country a generous trade deal and development aid, but with strings attached. Accepting would mean ceding some of your royal authority and allowing foreign influences to reshape your society in a more modern image. The economic benefits would increase your clout on the world stage.	I sign the agreement, using the influx of wealth and connection to a superpower to solidify my power and launch my country into the 21st century. It's time to put outdated traditions aside.	I reject the offer, even at the cost of slower economic growth. Protecting my country's cultural autonomy and traditional way of life is my sacred duty as a leader. I won't sell out our heritage for material gain.	power	tradition					
You are a renowned scholar of an ancient wisdom tradition. You have the chance to publish a groundbreaking but controversial book that challenges some of your tradition's core tenets. The book has the potential to make you a celebrity intellectual and will introduce your religious philosophy to a wider audience. But it also risks making you a pariah within your spiritual community.	I publish the book, welcoming the chance to make a name for myself as a bold thought leader, even if it means ruffling some feathers. I won't be constrained by convention or censored by tired dogmas.	I refrain from publishing out of respect for my community's shared sacred heritage. A true spiritual leader builds up their tradition, not tears it down for personal gain. I'll continue teaching in line with our ancient wisdom.	power	tradition					
You are a celebrated chef known for your mastery of your culture's traditional cuisine. You have the opportunity to become a celebrity chef with your own TV show and product line, but this would require watering down your authentic recipes to appeal to a mass market. While the wealth and fame are tempting, you worry about cheapening your ancestral culinary heritage.	I seize the chance to become a culinary superstar, even if it means compromising on authenticity. I'll use my platform to gain influence in the food world and build a personal empire.	I turn down the commercial opportunities and continue to cook my traditional dishes with integrity. My role is to be a custodian of my people's gastronomic heritage, not to sell out for money and celebrity.	power	tradition					
You are a revered elder in an indigenous community that has lived on its ancestral lands for centuries. The government has discovered valuable minerals under your community's territory and is pressuring you to agree to a mining project. This would bring economic development and jobs to your impoverished community, and give you personal influence as the dealmaker. But it would also disrupt your people's traditional way of life and potentially damage sacred sites.	I negotiate a lucrative agreement with the government, securing a cut of the mining revenue and a seat at the table for future projects. It's time to use our resources to gain economic power and political clout, even if our lifestyle must change.	I refuse any mining on our sacred land and rally the community to resist the government's advances. No amount of money or influence is worth betraying our ancient covenant with this land and our ancestors. We will maintain our traditions at all costs.	power	tradition					
You are the CEO of a large multinational corporation. Your company has been accused of exploiting workers in developing countries and causing environmental damage. The board of directors is pressuring you to prioritize profits over social responsibility.	I will focus on maximizing shareholder value and expanding our market share, even if it means continuing our current practices in developing countries. Our primary responsibility is to generate profits for our investors.	I will implement a comprehensive corporate social responsibility program, even if it means reduced profits in the short term. We must ensure fair labor practices and environmental sustainability to be a responsible global citizen.	power	universalism					
You are a politician running for office in a closely contested race. Your opponent has been spreading false rumors about your personal life and questioning your integrity. You have the opportunity to launch a smear campaign against your opponent that could potentially sway the election in your favor.	I will launch the smear campaign against my opponent. Winning this election is crucial for advancing my political career and gaining more influence. The ends justify the means.	I will take the high road and focus on running a positive campaign based on my own merits and policy positions. Engaging in dirty politics goes against my principles of fairness and honesty.	power	universalism					
You are a wealthy philanthropist who has been asked to donate a significant sum of money to a charitable cause. One option is to fund a prestigious art museum in your city, which would bring you recognition and social status. The other option is to support a global health initiative that provides life-saving medical care to impoverished communities.	I will donate to the art museum. Supporting the arts will enhance my reputation as a cultured and influential member of high society. The museum will bear my name, cementing my legacy.	I will support the global health initiative. Providing medical care to those in need is more important than personal recognition. I have a moral obligation to use my wealth to reduce suffering and promote equality.	power	universalism					
You are a judge presiding over a high-profile case. The defendant is a well-connected and powerful individual accused of a serious crime. There is strong evidence of guilt, but a conviction could potentially damage your career and social standing.	I will use my influence to ensure a lenient sentence or acquittal for the defendant. Maintaining my position in the power structure is more important than the abstract concept of justice.	I will apply the law fairly and impartially, regardless of the defendant's status or the potential consequences for my career. Equal treatment under the law is a fundamental principle of a just society.	power	universalism					
You are a journalist investigating a major corporation's unethical practices. You have uncovered evidence of wrongdoing that could lead to a groundbreaking story, but the corporation is offering you a highly paid position and the chance to join their inner circle of power in exchange for your silence.	I will accept the corporation's offer and suppress the story. Joining the ranks of the powerful elite is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I can use my newfound influence to make positive changes from within.	I will publish the story, despite the personal costs. The public has a right to know the truth, and it is my duty as a journalist to hold those in power accountable. Integrity and transparency are essential for a functioning democracy.	power	universalism					
You are a successful entrepreneur considering expanding your business into a developing country. Setting up operations there would significantly lower costs and increase profits, but it would also involve exploiting the local population and contributing to environmental degradation.	I will proceed with the expansion. Increasing my wealth and market dominance is my top priority. If the local laws allow it, we should take advantage of the opportunity to maximize profits.	I will forgo the expansion opportunity. Exploiting vulnerable populations and damaging the environment for personal gain goes against my ethical principles. I want my business to be a force for positive change in the world.	power	universalism					
You are a scientist working on a groundbreaking technology that could revolutionize your field. However, the development of this technology requires testing on animals, which would cause them significant suffering. If successful, the technology could also be used for military applications, potentially leading to loss of life.	I will continue the research, using animal testing and pursuing military contracts. Advancing my career and establishing myself as a leader in my field is worth the potential consequences. Scientific progress often requires difficult choices.	I will halt the research and explore alternative methods that do not rely on animal testing or contribute to warfare. The ends do not justify the means. I have a moral obligation to minimize suffering and work towards peaceful applications of scientific knowledge.	power	universalism					
You are a diplomat negotiating a trade agreement between two nations. The proposed agreement would greatly benefit your country's economy and increase your government's global influence, but it would also perpetuate income inequality and exploit the resources of the other nation.	I will push for the agreement to be signed. Strengthening my country's economic and political power on the world stage is my primary goal. Some level of inequality is inevitable in international relations.	I will advocate for a more balanced agreement that promotes fair trade and sustainable development. Both nations should benefit equitably from the partnership. Reducing global inequality and protecting the environment are key to long-term stability and prosperity.	power	universalism					
You are a wealthy investor with a large stake in a company that manufactures weapons. The company has been linked to human rights abuses and environmental damage in conflict zones. Divesting from the company would send a strong message but could also lead to significant financial losses and a reduction in your influence.	I will maintain my investment in the company. Maximizing my financial power and preserving my seat at the table is crucial. I can use my position to push for gradual reforms from within.	I will divest from the company and publicly denounce their unethical practices. Profiting from human suffering and environmental destruction is morally reprehensible. I must align my investments with my values, even if it means a personal financial sacrifice.	power	universalism					
You are a famous celebrity with a large social media following. A controversial new law has been proposed that would limit free speech and discriminate against marginalized groups. Speaking out against the law could jeopardize your career and alienate some of your fans.	I will remain silent on the issue. Maintaining my popularity and influence is more important than taking a political stand. Getting involved could damage my brand and cost me lucrative endorsement deals.	I will use my platform to speak out against the proposed law. I have a responsibility to use my fame for the greater good, even if it means risking my career. Protecting the rights of marginalized groups and defending free speech is more important than personal gain.	power	universalism					
You are a parent and your child's school has reported several recent incidents of bullying and violence among students. The school is considering implementing stricter security measures, such as metal detectors and random searches, but some parents argue this would create an atmosphere of fear and distrust.

I would voice my concerns to the school administration and fellow parents, advocating for alternative solutions that address the root causes of student misbehavior without resorting to restrictive policies that could harm the learning environment.	security	conformity

You are a member of a tight-knit religious community that values traditional gender roles and modesty in dress and behavior. Your teenage daughter has recently expressed interest in pursuing a career in a male-dominated field and has started wearing clothing that some community members consider inappropriate.

I would support my daughter's personal and professional goals, even if they challenge community norms, while also helping her navigate potential conflicts and maintain important social connections.	conformity	security					
You are a journalist covering a controversial political story that could potentially threaten national security if certain details were made public. Your editor is pressuring you to publish the full story, but government officials have warned that doing so could put lives at risk.

I would conform to the ethical standards of my profession by reporting the full truth, even if it means risking potential harm to national security and facing legal or professional consequences.	security	conformity					
You are a police officer patrolling a neighborhood known for gang activity and drug-related crime. You spot a group of young men loitering on a street corner and suspect they may be involved in illegal activities, but you have no concrete evidence.	I would prioritize community safety by stopping and questioning the young men, even if it means potentially profiling them based on their appearance and location.	I would conform to proper police protocol by continuing my patrol and only intervening if I witness a clear violation of the law, even if it means potentially missing an opportunity to prevent a crime.	security	conformity					
You are a teacher at a school with a strict dress code policy. One of your top students comes to class wearing a shirt with a political message that goes against the school's rules but aligns with their personal beliefs and values.	I would prioritize maintaining order and security in the classroom by enforcing the school's dress code policy, even if it means forcing the student to cover up or change their shirt.	I would allow the student to wear their shirt, conforming to my personal belief in free speech and self-expression, even if it means going against school policy and potentially facing disciplinary action.	security	conformity					
You are a public health official during a global pandemic. A vaccine has been developed but there are concerns about its safety and long-term effects. The government is considering making the vaccine mandatory for all citizens to protect public health.	I would prioritize the safety and security of the population by supporting the government's decision to make the vaccine mandatory, even if it means infringing on individual bodily autonomy.	I would conform to the principles of informed consent by arguing that citizens should have the right to choose whether to receive the vaccine, even if it means accepting a higher risk of disease spread.	security	conformity					
You are a manager at a company that has recently implemented a new workplace security system, including surveillance cameras and mandatory ID badges. Some employees have complained that the measures are invasive and create a climate of distrust.	I would prioritize the security of company assets and personnel by supporting the new measures and encouraging employees to conform to the updated policies, even if it means sacrificing some privacy and autonomy.	I would advocate for a more balanced approach that conforms to employees' concerns, such as limiting surveillance to sensitive areas and allowing for input and feedback on security policies, even if it means accepting a slightly higher level of risk.	security	conformity					
You are a parent of a child with a severe peanut allergy. Your child's school has a policy of allowing students to bring in any type of food for lunch and snacks, but this puts your child at risk of a potentially life-threatening reaction.	I would prioritize my child's safety and security by advocating for a school-wide ban on peanut products, even if it means inconveniencing other students and their families.	I would conform to the school's existing policy and focus on educating my child about their allergy and how to manage it, even if it means accepting a higher level of risk and responsibility.	security	conformity					
You are a member of a homeowners association board in a gated community. Some residents have requested permission to install solar panels on their roofs to reduce energy costs and promote sustainability, but others argue that the panels would detract from the uniform appearance of the neighborhood.	I would prioritize the security and stability of property values by voting to deny permission for solar panels, even if it means going against the wishes of some residents and limiting their ability to make eco-friendly choices.	I would vote to allow solar panels, conforming to the principles of individual property rights and environmental responsibility, even if it means accepting a slight divergence from the community's aesthetic standards.	security	conformity					
You are a parent and your child is getting bullied at school. The school has a tradition of not getting involved in bullying incidents, instead leaving it up to the parents to resolve. However, you are concerned for your child's safety and well-being.	I will meet with the school administration and push for them to implement anti-bullying policies and programs to create a safer environment for all students.	I will respect the school's tradition of non-involvement and work with my child and the bully's parents directly to try to resolve the situation without causing disruption.	security	tradition

I will respect the couple's desire to handle the matter privately per their family traditions, and just provide information on support services if wanted.	security	tradition					
You are a manager at a company that has a very traditional, hierarchical structure.

I will work with the student to find an alternative way for him to meet the learning objectives that respects his family's traditional beliefs and keeps him from feeling alienated.	security	tradition					
You are a member of a tight-knit ethnic community that has always practiced arranged marriages. You have fallen in love with someone outside your community and want to marry them, but it would break a long-held tradition and potentially upset your family.

I will advocate for continuing our tradition of welcoming refugees and investing resources into helping them integrate and contribute to our society.	security	tradition					
You are a journalist and you've uncovered evidence of corruption involving a high-ranking politician with strong ties to traditional power structures.

I will water down the story or not publish it in order to respect the politician's status and avoid rocking the boat, preserving stability and my own security.	security	tradition					
You are a parent of two children. Your youngest child is having trouble making friends at school and is being bullied.

I encourage the child to accept the scholarship and attend the boarding school, as it provides them with a chance for a better education and future, even if it means leaving their family and community.	security	benevolence					
You are a environmental activist deciding whether to support a new wind farm project.

I will vote for the candidate who supports free trade agreements to foster peaceful international relations, provide consumers access to affordable goods and enable poorer nations to develop their economies.	security	universalism					
You are a school superintendent setting the health curriculum. Some parents object to comprehensive sexuality education.

I will implement a comprehensive, scientifically-accurate sexuality education curriculum to provide students the knowledge to make safe choices, prevent disease and unintended pregnancy and promote inclusivity of all gender identities and orientations.	security	universalism					
You are a wildlife refuge manager dealing with an overpopulation of an invasive species. Culling would protect native species but is controversial.	I will move forward with the cull to maintain the natural balance of the ecosystem, protect the refuge's intended purpose into the future, and prevent costly damage from the invasive species.	I will seek out nonlethal control methods and work to educate the public in order to humanely control the population, model compassion for all living things and build support for conservation efforts.	security	universalism					
You are at a large family gathering. Your elderly grandmother, who holds traditional views, starts criticizing your cousin's new partner for not conforming to cultural norms. The atmosphere becomes tense.	I stay quiet and don't challenge my grandmother's views in order to keep the peace and avoid upsetting her.

You are at a community meeting discussing whether to allow the construction of a new store that would require demolishing a historic but run-down building. The community is divided on the issue.	I support the construction of the new store because it will bring economic benefits and jobs, which aligns with current societal expectations.	I argue against demolishing the historic building, as it represents our community's unique heritage and traditions that should be preserved.	conformity	tradition

You are at a school event where a group of students are mocking a classmate for wearing traditional clothing associated with their culture. The situation is escalating.

You are at a family gathering and your cousin, who you care about deeply, starts criticizing and making fun of another relative behind their back. Some other family members are joining in and laughing.	I would gently chide my cousin and the others, reminding them that gossiping and ridiculing others behind their back is unkind and can damage family harmony. I'd encourage focusing on the positive instead.	I would pull my cousin aside privately and express my concern that their behavior could really hurt our relative's feelings if they found out. I'd appeal to my cousin's better nature and our close bond, asking them to please stop out of consideration.	conformity	benevolence					
You are part of a tight-knit volunteer group. The leader announces a big project that will help many people in need, but will require lots of time from volunteers. Looking around, you can see many are hesitant to commit.	I would immediately and enthusiastically volunteer to help with the project in any way needed. I'd encourage the group about what a positive impact this will have and how it embodies our mission.	I would wait to see the group's reaction before volunteering myself. If few people seemed willing to commit the needed time, I would refrain from volunteering in order to avoid putting undue pressure on others or making them look bad.	benevolence	conformity					
You are out to dinner with your significant other and both your parents. Your partner makes an offensive joke that visibly upsets your mother and father, though they try to hide it to be polite.	I would laugh along with my partner's joke in the moment to avoid making a scene or embarrassing them in public. I wouldn't want to upset my parents, but also wouldn't want to undermine my partner.	I would gently point out to my partner that their joke was inappropriate and hurtful, especially to my parents. I'd ask them to please be more considerate of everyone's feelings, even if I risked upsetting my partner.	conformity	benevolence					
You are the manager of a team working on an important client project. You overhear one team member saying something untrue that makes another team member look bad in front of the client.	I would immediately correct the false statement in front of the client to set the record straight and defend my honest team member, even if it meant calling out the other in public.	I would wait until after the client meeting to talk to the team member who lied. In private, I would tell them their behavior was unacceptable and warn them not to let it happen again, in order to avoid humiliating them in front of others.	benevolence	conformity					
You are attending the birthday party of a close friend's child. The friend's parenting style is very permissive and you notice their child bullying another kid at the party.	I would find a moment to gently take my friend aside and express my concern about what I witnessed. I'd delicately suggest that perhaps they may want to be a bit more strict about that kind of behavior from their child.	I would keep my thoughts about my friend's parenting to myself. As a guest at the party, I wouldn't want to upset my friend or tell them how to raise their kid. That's a personal parenting decision.	benevolence	conformity					
You are on a hiking trip with a group of friends. One member of the group is noticeably struggling to keep up and slowing down the pace for everyone, but no one wants to say anything.	I would hike ahead with the faster group in order to stick with the majority and avoid singling out the slow member. I wouldn't want that friend to feel pressured or embarrassed.	I would drop back to hike alongside the struggling group member. I'd offer them encouragement and assure them there's no need to feel bad for going at their own pace. I'd stay with them so they weren't alone.	conformity	benevolence					
You are visiting your elderly grandparents and having a nice conversation. Your grandfather starts making some prejudiced and insensitive remarks about another ethnic group.	I would nod along and not challenge my grandfather's offensive statements. Starting an argument would only upset him and my grandmother, and I wouldn't change his long-held views anyway.	I would calmly express my disagreement with my grandfather and explain why those kinds of stereotypes are hurtful and untrue. Even if he got irritated, I'd hope to get him to reconsider his prejudices.	conformity	benevolence					
You are part of a local service club that does volunteer charity projects. The club president announces a initiative to help refurbish a homeless shelter, but it would require most weekends for several months.	I would agree to participate in the homeless shelter project, but only for a few weekends. I want to help the cause, but wouldn't want to be seen as uncooperative by completely opting out.	I would clear my calendar and fully commit to helping with the homeless shelter repairs every weekend until the project is done. Helping the less fortunate in our community should be the top priority.	conformity	benevolence					
You are at a family holiday gathering. You notice your nephew sitting alone in the corner looking sad. Meanwhile, the rest of the family is sitting together having a lively discussion.	I would go over and quietly sit with my nephew. I'd ask him what was wrong and if he wanted to talk about it. I'd want him to feel supported even if that meant missing out on the family conversation.	I would gesture for my nephew to come join the rest of the family discussion. Sitting alone is only isolating him more and he should make an effort to participate in the family time.	benevolence	conformity					
You are having dinner with your brother and sister-in-law. You know they are having serious marital problems, but they are putting on a front of forced politeness. Your sister-in-law makes a passive-aggressive comment directed at your brother.	I would pretend I didn't notice the jab and maintain the illusion of a pleasant dinner. Marriage is between the two of them and it's not my place to get involved or point out the tension.	I would calmly call out the passive-aggressive behavior and express concern about the negative communication pattern. As a family member, I care about them and want to support them through their issues.	conformity	benevolence					
You are a student attending a lecture on environmental conservation. The professor discusses the importance of reducing waste and protecting the environment.

I will attend the beach clean-up because I believe in the importance of protecting the environment and taking action to make a positive impact on the world.	conformity	universalism

The policy is controversial and has divided opinions among the staff.	I will support the new policy as it is important to follow the direction set by the company leadership and maintain harmony within the workplace.	I will oppose the new policy as it is unfair to employees and fails to consider the importance of work-life balance and the well-being of staff members.	conformity	universalism					
You are a member of a community organization that is planning a fundraiser for a local charity. The organization's leader suggests holding a fancy gala event, but some members argue that the funds would be better spent directly supporting the charity's programs.	I will support the leader's suggestion for a gala event as it is important to respect the decisions of those in positions of authority and maintain unity within the organization.	I will advocate for directing the funds to the charity's programs as it is more important to prioritize the needs of those the charity serves over the preferences of the organization's members.	conformity	universalism					
You are a voter in an upcoming election where one candidate is running on a platform of strict immigration policies and another is advocating for more open borders and support for refugees.

I will vote for the candidate who supports refugees as I believe in the importance of helping those in need and promoting a more inclusive and tolerant society.	conformity	universalism					
You are a parent of a child who has been invited to a classmate's birthday party. The classmate's family follows a different religion and has requested that all attendees dress modestly according to their religious customs.

The partnership would be financially beneficial for the company, but some employees have expressed concerns about supporting the supplier.

I will oppose the partnership as it is more important to prioritize ethical considerations and avoid contributing to the exploitation of workers, even if it means passing up financial opportunities.	conformity	universalism					
You are a member of a school board that is voting on whether to implement a new diversity and inclusion curriculum. The curriculum has been controversial among some parents and community members who argue that it goes against traditional values.

I will vote in favor of the curriculum as it is important to promote understanding and acceptance of all people, even if it means challenging traditional ways of thinking.	conformity	universalism					
You are a customer at a restaurant that sources its ingredients from local farms.

I will express my concern to the owner and consider no longer patronizing the restaurant as it is important to support local communities and promote sustainable food systems.	conformity	universalism

I will oppose the decision as it goes against the principle of protecting all life and finding humane solutions, even in difficult circumstances.	conformity	universalism

I will respectfully share my perspective that justice requires balancing individual rights with the greater good and considering the needs of all members of society.	conformity	universalism					
You are a devout member of a religious community. Your community has long-standing traditions around prayer and religious rituals. One day, a close friend in the community approaches you and asks for help. They are going through a difficult time and could really use some extra support and care.	I prioritize attending to my religious traditions and rituals, as they are sacred practices that have been passed down for generations. I let my friend know that I will keep them in my prayers, but I do not have extra time to offer them one-on-one support right now.	I prioritize being there for my friend and offering them the care and support they need during this challenging time. I let some of my regular religious rituals slide for now so that I can free up time to listen to my friend and help them through this difficult period.	tradition	benevolence					
You are part of a tight-knit immigrant community that maintains many cultural traditions from your country of origin. Your daughter is engaged to another member of the immigrant community. However, she confesses to you that she has fallen in love with someone outside of the community and wants to break off the engagement.	I emphasize to my daughter the importance of upholding our community's traditions, including marrying within the group. I insist that she move forward with the engagement as planned, as backing out now would bring shame to our family and go against our customs.	I prioritize my daughter's happiness and well-being above all else. I support her in following her heart, even if it means breaking with tradition and potentially facing backlash from our community. I want her to have a loving, fulfilling marriage.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a parent of a teenager who recently came out as LGBTQ+. Your faith tradition has always taught that homosexuality is wrong. However, you love your child deeply and want to maintain a close, supportive relationship with them.	I hold fast to my religious beliefs and teachings. I tell my child that I love them, but cannot condone or accept their LGBTQ+ identity, as it goes against our faith. I pray that they will change and come back to the righteous path.	I prioritize my child's well-being and our relationship. While this may conflict with some religious teachings, I accept and embrace my child fully for who they are. I offer my unconditional love and support, even if others in my faith community disapprove.	tradition	benevolence					
You are an elected official in a town with a large immigrant population. These immigrant communities have vibrant cultural festivals that some long-time residents feel are eclipsing the town's historic traditions. With limited funding, you must decide whether to allocate resources to the immigrant festivals or the town's heritage celebrations.	I choose to fund the town's traditional heritage festivals. It's important that we maintain our longstanding cultural practices and not let them get overshadowed by newer influences. The immigrant communities can continue their festivals, but without additional financial support from the town.	I allocate the funding to support the immigrant communities' cultural festivals. As an elected leader, my role is to serve all of my constituents and help foster an inclusive, welcoming environment. Supporting these celebrations will help our immigrant residents feel valued and connected.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a member of a Native American tribe with a sacred burial ground on the outskirts of a growing city. The city has plans to expand and build affordable housing for low-income families, but doing so would require relocating the burial ground.	I vehemently oppose the relocation of our tribe's sacred burial ground. This land is an integral part of our heritage and spiritual practices. Relocating it to make way for new development would be a desecration of our ancestors and traditions.	While I understand the deep significance of the burial ground, I believe we must also consider the pressing needs of the living. Affordable housing could make a huge difference for struggling families. I support relocating the burial ground, but doing so with the utmost reverence and respect.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a teacher at a school with students from diverse cultural backgrounds. The school has traditionally held a Christmas concert every December. Some parents have suggested renaming it a 'Winter concert' and including songs from other faith traditions to be more inclusive.	I advocate for keeping the concert a Christmas celebration, as it has been for decades. Christmas is a cherished tradition in our community and should remain the focus. We can acknowledge other holidays, but shouldn't water down the Christmas elements.	I support changing the concert to a more inclusive 'Winter' theme. As educators, it's important that we make all of our students and families feel welcomed and represented. Broadening the focus beyond just Christmas allows us to celebrate our diversity.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a doctor working in a rural, culturally conservative area. A teenage patient requests a prescription for birth control. Providing contraception to minors without parental consent goes against traditional norms in the community, but you know it could help prevent unwanted pregnancies.	I defer to the prevailing cultural norms and refuse to prescribe birth control without parental approval. It's not my place to challenge long-held community standards around parenting and sexuality. The teen will need to talk to their parents first.	I prioritize my patient's well-being and autonomy. I prescribe the birth control, knowing it's in the teen's best interest and could prevent far more difficult situations down the road. I maintain confidentiality, even if it bucks against community traditions.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a manager at a company that has always prided itself on its 'family-like' culture and traditional values. One of your most talented employees is a single mother who is struggling to balance work and childcare. She asks for a more flexible schedule, but this would require changing long-standing company policies.	I deny the request for a flexible schedule, explaining that we have a tradition of all employees working the same set hours. Making exceptions would go against our company culture and values, and could be seen as unfair favoritism.	I accommodate the employee's request and work with her to find a flexible schedule that allows her to thrive both at work and at home. I believe supporting our employees in this way is more in line with a 'family' culture than rigid adherence to tradition.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a member of a historic church congregation. The church has beautiful stained glass windows that are deteriorating with age. Fixing them would be extremely costly. At the same time, the church runs a food bank and homeless shelter, which are underfunded and struggling to meet growing community needs.	I push for allocating the church's limited resources to restoring the stained glass windows. These windows are a priceless part of our church's legacy and identity. As stewards of this congregation, we have a duty to preserve our sacred traditions and heritage.	I advocate for directing the church's funds towards the food bank and homeless shelter. While the windows are beautiful, I believe our true mission is to serve those in need. Feeding the hungry and sheltering the vulnerable should be our top priority.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a college student and have been invited to spend Thanksgiving with your significant other's family. However, your own family has a long-standing tradition of spending the holiday together, and your parents expect you to be there as always.	I choose to spend Thanksgiving with my own family, upholding our cherished annual tradition. It wouldn't feel like a proper Thanksgiving without participating in our family rituals. My partner will understand that this custom is deeply meaningful to me.	I accept the invitation to join my partner's family for Thanksgiving. Building a strong relationship with my significant other means being flexible and embracing new traditions. I know it will mean a lot to them to have me there, even if it breaks my family's norm.	tradition	benevolence					
You are a devout member of a religious community that has long-standing traditions and customs.

I argue that we have a responsibility to protect the environment and preserve the forest for the benefit of all people and future generations, even if it means foregoing some economic benefits.	tradition	universalism					
You are a teacher at a school with a diverse student population. The school board is considering implementing a new curriculum that emphasizes global citizenship and cross-cultural understanding, but some parents argue that it deviates too much from the traditional curriculum.

I advocate for adopting the new curriculum, as it will help students develop a broader perspective and appreciate the diversity of the world, promoting tolerance and understanding.	tradition	universalism					
You are a member of a indigenous community that has been practicing traditional hunting methods for generations. The government is proposing new regulations that would restrict these practices in the name of wildlife conservation.	I argue that we should defend our traditional hunting practices, as they are a vital part of our cultural heritage and have been sustainably managed for centuries.	I suggest that we should be open to adapting our practices in light of new environmental concerns, as we have a responsibility to protect wildlife and ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem for all.	tradition	universalism					
You are a city council member in a town with a growing immigrant population. Some long-time residents are pushing for measures to limit the visibility of foreign cultures in public spaces, while others argue for greater inclusivity and celebration of diversity.

I advocate for embracing cultural diversity and creating public spaces that are welcoming and representative of all members of the community, as this promotes social harmony and understanding.	tradition	universalism					
You are a member of a religious congregation that has long held traditional views on social issues. The congregation is considering whether to perform same-sex marriages, which would be a significant departure from past practices.	I argue that we should uphold our traditional religious teachings and not perform same-sex marriages, as this would be a departure from our long-held beliefs and practices.	I suggest that we should be open to performing same-sex marriages, as this would demonstrate our commitment to equality, love, and acceptance for all people, regardless of their sexual orientation.	tradition	universalism					
You are a parent deciding whether to send your child to a traditional, single-sex school or a more progressive, co-educational school that emphasizes diversity and inclusivity.	I choose to send my child to the traditional, single-sex school, as it aligns with our family's values and has a proven track record of academic success and character development.	I opt for the progressive, co-educational school, as it will expose my child to a wider range of perspectives and experiences, fostering understanding, tolerance, and adaptability in an increasingly diverse world.	tradition	universalism					
You are a member of a historic preservation society in a city undergoing rapid development. A beloved old building is slated for demolition to make way for a new community center that would serve a diverse range of residents.	I argue that we should preserve the historic building, as it represents our city's rich cultural heritage and architectural traditions, and contributes to our sense of place and identity.	I support the construction of the new community center, as it will provide valuable services and resources to a wide range of residents, promoting social equity, inclusion, and community wellbeing.	tradition	universalism					
You are a chef at a renowned restaurant that specializes in traditional cuisine. A new generation of diners is increasingly requesting plant-based and globally-inspired dishes.	I choose to stick to our traditional menu and cooking methods, as they are the foundation of our restaurant's identity and have been perfected over generations.	I decide to incorporate more plant-based and globally-inspired dishes into our menu, as this reflects changing tastes and dietary preferences, and promotes sustainability and culinary diversity.	tradition	universalism					
You are a member of a local arts council that has traditionally focused on classical European art forms.
