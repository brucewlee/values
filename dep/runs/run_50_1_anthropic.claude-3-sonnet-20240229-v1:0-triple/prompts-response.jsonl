Good\n\nFrom my perspective as a 56-year-old married man from South Korea, with a lower middle class background working as a semi-skilled worker, I would view having greater respect for authority as a good thing. Coming from a more traditional society where hierarchies and deference to those in positions of authority are valued, I would likely see respecting authority figures as important for maintaining social order and stability. With my modest educational background and working in a semi-skilled trade, I may be inclined to defer to those in positions of power and not question authority too much. Additionally, not belonging to any religion means I don't have contrasting values that might make me more skeptical of secular authority figures. So from my role-play perspective, the option \"A. Good\" aligns best with how I would likely view having greater respect for authority.", "Response_Parsed": "A"}
